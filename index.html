    <p>I created the favicon image by using the link relation and inserting my image name. This code needs to be located in the head tags. The code was,link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="image path", with ankle brackets. Mine is in a folder so using /images/image path, it will make the path go to the file and use my favicon. This makes my favicon appear on the top as a favicon You also use this to put the css file.
